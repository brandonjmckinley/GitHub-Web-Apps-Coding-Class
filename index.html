      <p>The marimba is a percussion instrument consisting of a set of wooden bars struck with yarn or rubber mallets to produce musical tones. Resonators or pipes suspended underneath the bars amplify their sound. The bars of a chromatic marimba are arranged like the keys of a piano, with the groups of two and three accidentals raised vertically, overlapping the natural bars to aid the performer both visually and physically. This instrument is a type of idiophone but with a more resonant and lower-pitched tessitura than the xylophone. A person who plays the marimba is called a <em>marimbist</em> or a <em>marimba player</em>.</p>

      <p>Xylophones are widely used in music of west and central Africa. In Latin America, enslaved Africans recreated them in the 16th and 17th centuries. The name <em> marimba </em> stems from Bantu <em> marimba </em> or <em>malimba</em>, 'xylophone'. According to some Western sources, the word 'marimba' is formed from <em>ma</em> 'many' and <em>rimba</em> 'single-bar xylophone,' however the use of the term marimba and/or derivative terms is not present in any West African language. The instrument itself is present but is called balafon or heri in Mali and/or Guinea, while it is known as gyil among the Akan peoples in and around Ghana. The word marimba and derivative words is used widely in East, Central and Southern Africa.</p>

    <h2>Mallet Technique</h2>

      <p>Modern marimba music calls for simultaneous use of between two and four mallets (sometimes up to six or eight), granting the performer the ability to play chords or music with large interval skips more easily. Multiple mallets are held in the same hand using any of a number of techniques or <em>grips</em>. For two mallets in each hand, the most common grips are the Burton grip (made popular by Gary Burton), the Traditional Grip (or "cross grip") and the Musser-Stevens grip (made popular by Leigh Howard Stevens). Each grip is perceived to have its own benefits and drawbacks. For example, some marimbists feel the Musser-Stevens grip is more suitable for quick interval changes and mallet independence, while the Burton grip is more suitable for stronger playing or switching between chords and single-note melody lines. The Traditional Grip gives a greater dynamic range and freedom of playing.</p>
